est. 1997, 600 classes (103 classes in java.text.resources, which will be removed into runtime i18n.jar later, so actually 497), jdk ~20Mb

## Language changes

Inner classes - before that two toplevel classes in the same file

## Tools

New tools:

 - jar - yes, now you can package your files into a .jar (but only for quick download, no main-class yet)
 - javakey - the predecessor of keytool 
 - javaverify - ?
 - native2ascii - this should fix a problem with UTF-8 properties not understood
 - rmic - RMI compiler - probably you don't need it
 - rmiregistry - RMI Registry - RMI 'service discovery'
 - serialver - shows serialVersionUID for a class (this release got Serializable)

## Packages

New packages:

 - beans (mostly irrelevant)
        
    Contains classes related to developing beans -- components based on the JavaBeansâ„¢ architecture. A few of the classes are used by beans while they run in an application. For example, the event classes are used by beans that fire property and vetoable change events (see PropertyChangeEvent). However, <b>most of the classes in this package are meant to be used by a bean editor</b> (that is, a development environment for customizing and putting together beans to create an application). In particular, these classes help the bean editor create a user interface that the user can use to customize the bean. For example, a bean may contain a property of a special type that a bean editor may not know how to handle. By using the PropertyEditor interface, a bean developer can provide an editor for this special type.

    Quote from the above website:
    
    Before discussing any particular aspect of the JavaBeans component model, we must underline the fact that JavaBeans were mainly designed with <b>visually assembly inside builder tools in mind</b>.
